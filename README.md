# Package Review: Zod

A review and showcase of Zod, the TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.

* Install with `npm install zod`
* Documentation: [zod.dev](https://zod.dev)

## Overview of Zod



## Options and Configurations

I like the Options Object pattern when I want to enable others to configure the default behavior or settings of something, such as a function or class. Zod makes this easy by allowing you to define options and all of their default values using an Object Schema.

## Running Code Examples

* Ensure you have NPM installed
* Run $ `npm install`
* Run $ `npx ts-node zod-example-params-options-configs.ts`
  * Swap out the filename for your desired example
